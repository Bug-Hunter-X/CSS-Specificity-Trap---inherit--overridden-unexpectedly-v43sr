The solution is to either remove the conflicting style `div p { color: green; }` or modify the selectors to correctly apply inheritance:

**Solution 1: Remove conflicting style:**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: inherit; /* Now this will work, inheriting blue */
}
```

**Solution 2: Adjust specificity (if removing is not an option):**

If you need the `div p { color: green; }` style for other reasons, you can adjust the specificity of the `inherit` style.  This might involve creating a more specific selector that targets the paragraph with the desired inheritance.  The specific adjustment depends on the context and overall CSS structure.
