The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style will be applied */
}

div p {
  color: inherit; /* This style will be overridden */
}
```

The `inherit` keyword intends to inherit the color from the parent element (`div`). However, due to the higher specificity of `div p { color: green; }`, this `inherit` declaration is superseded. The resulting text color will be green, not blue (as might be expected).
